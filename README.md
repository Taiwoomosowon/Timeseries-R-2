This project aimed to investigate the relationship between education and income while considering various demographic variables such as age, gender, race, occupation, and marital status. The analysis was performed using logistic regression with salary as the dependent variable and the various demographic variables and education as independent variables. The results indicated that education alone is not a significant predictor of income, with an estimated coefficient of -0.02755 and a p-value of 0.64527. However, age and hours worked per week were significant predictors of income, with positive coefficients of 0.51697 and 0.04815, respectively. Additionally, the results suggested that certain demographic variables significantly impact income. Working class was found to have a positive relationship with income, while marital status was negatively associated with income. Race, sex, occupation, and relationship were found to have no significant effect on income. The study also investigated the gender differences in the relationship between education and income and found that there were no significant differences in the effect of education on income between males and females. The study identified that education is not the sole predictor of income, and several other demographic variables play a crucial role in determining income levels.
